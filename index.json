However, most multi‑hazard metrics don’t separate direct impacts (e.g., wind damage along the storm’s path) from indirect effects (e.g., rainfall intensified by mountains). This study introduces the **Hurricane Impact Index (HII)**, a comprehensive metric that integrates both direct and indirect hurricane hazards within a unified framework. We subdivided the study area into 1º x 1º grid cells and quantified direct impacts using a binary indicator triggered when grid‐cell vorticity exceeds the hurricane‐specific 90th percentile within a 500km radius. Indirect impacts are identified by imposing angular constraints on wind vectors relative to local mountain‐range axes, based on AppEEARS topography (elevation ≥ 500m), thereby capturing orographic flow modifications. Both components incorporate normalized precipitation and wind‐speed factors (scaled between each cell’s 10th and 90th percentiles) to account for geophysical variability and seasonality. We applied HII to six major hurricanes affecting Central America (2016–2022) and validated our results against DesInventar disaster records for Costa Rica. Findings reveal markedly elevated HII values along the Pacific coast, driven primarily by indirect rainfall amplification, and demonstrate strong spatial concordance with reported impacts despite resolution differences. Temporal aggregation of HII time series uncovers peak impact phases and supports refined vulnerability mapping, early‐warning systems, and resource‐allocation strategies. Furthermore, the index’s computational efficiency and exploratory robustness enable its extension to ensemble‑based future hurricane scenarios. The HII breaks down and measures different hurricane hazards, giving disaster managers, policymakers, and researchers a scalable tool to improve community resilience and preparedness.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Hurricane Impact Index: Capturing Direct and Indirect Cyclone Effects in Central America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

To achieve this, we use three methodologies; a) a climate model-based approach, b) a hybrid method that combines models and observations (1979–2019), and c) a climate observations-based method (1983–2016). For each methodology, we compare the climate change signal, represented by the historical trends, to the noise generated by simulated climate datasets (using models or statistical methods) that do not include human influence. Overall, the model-based method suggests possible detection of the human influence in most temperature extreme indices and in precipitation-related indices in the northern countries. The hybrid method detects human influence in significantly fewer variables, but in many cases, consistently with those of the model-based approach. Both the hybrid and observation-based methods exhibit similar noise variability to the model-based method. Notably, due to limitations in data availability, our analysis excludes the most recent five years, during which substantial warming and an increase of extreme events have been observed globally.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Detection and attribution of trends of meteorological extremes in Central America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jose Pablo Arroyo-Castro","Shu Wei Chou Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1745280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1745280000,"objectID":"793f5f238873fadc8ee51b9821689756","permalink":"https://swchouchen.github.io/publication/2025arroyocastro/","publishdate":"2025-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025arroyocastro/","section":"publication","summary":"The procurement of goods and services in Public Administration is crucial for achieving institutional goals, with a focus on financial responsibility and transparent decision-making.

Machine Learning techniques, particularly under unsupervised approaches, enhance anomaly detection.

Various indicators, such as realistic budget estimation and objection rates, are utilized. Rapid procurement processes and price alterations may signal vulnerabilities and misconduct, highlighting the need for transparency and market awareness.

Specifically, we apply this model class to explain the weekly hospitalization for respiratory diseases in Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil, by incorporating climate and pollution as covariates, trend and seasonality. The main feature of this model class is its capability of considering a set of explanatory variables with linear and nonlinear structures, which allows, for example, to model jointly trend and seasonality of a time series with additive functions for the nonlinear explanatory variables and a predictor to accommodate discrete and linear explanatory variables. Additionally, the conditional symmetric errors allow the possibility of fitting data with high correlation order, as well as error distributions with heavier or lighter tails than the normal ones. We present the model class and a novel iterative process is derived by combining a P-GAM type algorithm with a quasi-Newton procedure for the parameter estimation.

The variation in the increasing number of cases depends greatly on climatic seasonal effects, socioeconomic factors, and pollution. Therefore, understanding these variations and obtaining precise forecasts allows health authorities to make correct decisions regarding the allocation of limited economic and human resources. We aimed to model and forecast weekly hospitalizations due to respiratory conditions in seven regional hospitals in Costa Rica using four statistical learning techniques (Random Forest, XGboost, Facebook's Prophet forecasting model, and an ensemble method combining the above methods), along with 22 climate change indices and aerosol optical depth as an indicator of pollution. Models were trained using data from 2000 to 2018 and were evaluated using data from 2019 as testing data. During the training period, we set up 2-year sliding windows and a 1-year assessment period, along with the grid search method to optimize hyperparameters for each model. The best model for each region was selected using testing data, based on predictive precision and to prevent overfitting. Prediction intervals were then computed using conformal inference. The relative importance of all climatic variables was computed for the best model, and similar patterns in some of the seven regions were observed based on the selected model. Finally, reliable predictions were obtained for each of the seven regional hospitals.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Forecasting hospital discharges for respiratory conditions in Costa Rica using climate and pollution data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XXIV Simposio Internacional de Métodos Matemáticos Aplicados a las Ciencias (XXIV SIMMAC)\nJornada de Investigación.

Significant challenges such as climate change, the burden on health systems, and the rise of insecticide resistance highlight the need to introduce new and cost-effective tools for developing public health interventions. Various and locally adapted statistical methods for developing climate-based early warning systems have increasingly been an area of interest and research worldwide. Costa Rica, a country with microclimates and endemic circulation of the dengue virus (DENV) since 1993, provides ideal conditions for developing projection models with the potential to help guide public health efforts and interventions to control and monitor future dengue outbreaks. Climate information was incorporated to model and forecast the dengue cases and relative risks using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model, from 2000 to 2021, in 32 Costa Rican municipalities. This approach is capable of analyzing the spatio-temporal behavior of dengue and also producing reliable predictions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bayesian spatio-temporal model with INLA for dengue fever risk prediction in Costa Rica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yury E.

This study focuses on Costa Rica, a country characterized by diverse microclimates nearby, where dengue has been endemic since its introduction in 1993. Using wavelet coherence and clustering analysis, we performed a time-series analysis to uncover the intricate connections between climate, local environmental factors, and dengue occurrences. The findings indicate that multiannual dengue frequency (3 yr) is correlated with the Oceanic Niño Index and the Tropical North Atlantic Index. This association is particularly prominent in cantons located along the North and South Pacific Coast, as well as in the Central cantons of the country. Furthermore, the time series of these climate indices exhibit a leading phase of approximately nine months ahead of dengue cases. Additionally, the clustering analysis uncovers non-contiguous groups of cantons that exhibit similar correlation patterns, irrespective of their proximity or adjacency. This highlights the significance of climate factors in influencing dengue dynamics across diverse regions, regardless of spatial closeness or distance between them. On the other hand, the annual dengue frequency was correlated with local environmental indices. A persistent correlation between dengue cases and local environmental variables is observed over time in the North Pacific and the Central Region of the country’s Northwest, with environmental factors leading by less than three months. These findings contribute to understanding dengue transmission’s spatial and temporal dynamics in Costa Rica, highlighting the importance of climate and local environmental factors in dengue surveillance and control efforts.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Common patterns between dengue cases, climate, and local environmental variables in Costa Rica: A wavelet approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Jornada de Investigación.

In this article, we describe how to use a spatio-temporal statistical model with varying coefficients (VC), as a downscaling emulator for a RCM using VC. In order to estimate the proposed model, two options are compared; INLA, and varycoef. We set up a simulation to compare the performance of both methods for building a statistical downscaling emulator for RCM, and then show that the emulator works properly for NARCCAP data. The results show that the model is able to estimate non-stationary marginal effects, which means that the downscaling output can vary over space. Furthermore, the model has flexibility to estimate the mean of any variable in space and time, and has good prediction results. INLA was the fastest method for all the cases, and the approximation with best accuracy to estimate the different parameters from the model and the posterior distribution of the response variable.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Spatio-temporal downscaling emulator for regional climate models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XII Foro Internacional de Estadístsica, Facultad de Estadística e Informática, Universidad Veracruzana, México.\n","date":1684774800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684774800,"objectID":"e89fbda3a2e8d7d80ad9a7cda57a96d8","permalink":"https://swchouchen.github.io/talk/conference-2023-05-xalapa/","publishdate":"2023-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-2023-05-xalapa/","section":"talk","summary":"XII Foro Internacional de Estadístsica, Facultad de Estadística e Informática, Universidad Veracruzana, México.","tags":[],"title":"Modelos predictivos aplicados a datos climáticos y dengue.

Dengue fever is a vector-borne disease affecting millions yearly, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. Driven mainly by social and environmental factors, dengue incidence and geographical expansion have increased in recent decades. Therefore, understanding how climate variables drive dengue outbreaks is challenging and a problem of interest for decision-makers that could aid in improving surveillance and resource allocation. Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach. Models use a training period from 2000 to 2020 and predicted climatic variables obtained with a vector auto-regressive model. Results show reliable projections, and climate variables predictions allow for a prospective instead of a retrospective study.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Assessing dengue fever risk in Costa Rica by using climate variables and machine learning techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"XV Jornadas de Análisis Estadístico, Escuela de Estadística, UCR.\n","date":1661533200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661533200,"objectID":"65108fc3d648209b616403500f30c041","permalink":"https://swchouchen.github.io/talk/conference-2022-08-jornadas-estadistica/","publishdate":"2021-01-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/conference-2022-08-jornadas-estadistica/","section":"talk","summary":"XV Jornadas de Análisis Estadístico, Escuela de Estadística, UCR.","tags":[],"title":"Predicción de los riesgos de dengue en Costa Rica mediante el uso de variables climáticas y técnicas de aprendizaje automático.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Paola Vásquez","Fabio Sanchez","Luis A.
